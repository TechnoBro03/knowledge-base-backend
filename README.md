# Knowledge Base - Project for COMPSCI 476 Software Engineering.

## Project Info
The goal of this project was to create a Wiki that would allow easy access to a large amount of information.
Users can read, write, create, search, etc new files and store them within specified directories for easy organization.

## My task
My task in this project was to create the underlying database. It uses a directory-based system to organize and store markdown files in an easy and fast way.
I also assisted with the API that connected the frontend website with the backend database.
I implemented things like user authentication, search algorithms, and file storage systems.
